Hello fellow Odin classmates!
This is my Google Homepage solution.
At first i didnt know how those elements appear at the top right and bottom 
right so what i did is give each elements id's and classes and give them an absolute position lol,
until i saw the spans on the real homepage using the chrome dev tools and giving them float property. 
As for the the microphone and magnifying glass, i gave them absolute position.

Its aint much but it's honest work I guess...
